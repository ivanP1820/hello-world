# hello-world
This repository is my first repository for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm a teacher. I teach IB MYP Mathematics years 4 and 5 and IB Diploma Mathematics.
I've been teaching for 21 years only in one school, Pelita Harapan School, Indonesia.
I want to expand my mathematics classes' teaching-learning experience by exploring applied mathematics using coding.
